This my TP3 of C#.

Once downloaded you can open it with an IDE or double click TP1.sln if you have one installed. The main entry point for this program is "Program.cs".

All the exercises have been done. One .cs file has been created for each exercise and these files contain at least a class in which are defined the methods asked in the exercise.

Once the program is launched, all the classes are instanciate, and every functions are executed one by one.
